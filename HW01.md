# HW01-Differences
*HW01: Differences created by GitHub Classroom*

## The Set-up
I threw a bunch of things at you today. Now I want you to establish your workflow and get comfortable with all the moving parts of MATLAB and Python. The GradCompPhys repository contains a folder for each language we'll use this semester. The MATLAB and Python folder should contain 3 notebooks and 1 raw program each. The notebooks are for your reference; they contain some good information and good syntax examples. The *.m* and *.py* files contain function(s) that I have written (or 'stole"). Functions have specific input and specific output - study what the input and output of these functions are. 
## The Goal
I would like you to use the syntax examples from the notebooks and the program files to compare the derivatives and second derivatives of the functions and some data. I want you to 
<ol>
<li> Modify *Der.m* and *myder.py* to include higher order methods for taking the derivatives as listed in the notes on Blackboard.  </li>
<li> Write a program or a notebook (or modify an existing one) that plots the $\sin^2{\frac{1}{x(2-x)}}$, its derivative, and its second derivative.   </li>
<li>   Write a program or a notebook (or modify an existing one) that plots the data (in the *derdata.mat* file), its derivative, and its second derivative. </li>
</ol>
